<h1>The Ascend</h1>

<p class="dialogue">
    Socrates: Now, let's say that he is forcibly dragged up the steep climb out of the cavern, and firmly held until finally he stands in the light of the sun. Don't you think that he would be agitated and even begin to complain?
    <br><br>Under that light, would his eyes not be nearly blinded, unable to discern any of those things that we ourselves call real?
    </p>
    <p class="G G1">Glaukon: No, he wouldn't see them at first.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Socrates: It would take time, I suppose, for him to get used to seeing higher things. In the beginning, he might only trace the shadows. Then, reflections of people and other things in the water. Next he would come to see the things themselves. Then he would behold the heavenly bodies, and the heaven itself by night, seeing the light of the stars and the moon with greater ease than the sun and its light by day.</p>
    <p class="G G1">Glaukon: Indeed so.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">Socrates: And then, I think, he would at last be able to gaze upon the sun itself--neither as reflected in water, nor as a phantom image in some other place, but in its own place as it really is.
    </p>
    <p class="G G1">Glaukon: Undeniably.</p>
