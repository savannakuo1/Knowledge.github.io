<h1>The Ascend</h1>

<p class="dialogue">
    Socrates: And now allow me to draw a comparison in order to understand the effect of learning (or the lack of) upon our nature. 
    Imagine that there are people living in a cave deep underground. The cavern has a mouth that opens to the light above, and a passage exists from this all the way down to the people. 
    They have lived here from infancy, with their legs and necks bound in chains. They cannot move. All they can do is stare directly forward, as the chains stop them from turning their heads around. 
    Imagine that far above and behind them blazes a great fire. Between this fire and the captives, a low partition is erected along a path, something like puppeteers use to conceal themselves during their shows.
