    <h1>The Sun</h1>

<p class="dialogue">
    Socrates: And now allow me to draw a comparison in order to understand the effect of learning (or the lack thereof) upon our nature. 
    Imagine that there are people living in a cave deep underground. The cavern has a mouth that opens to the light above, and a passage exists from this all the way down to the people. 
    They have lived here from infancy, with their legs and necks bound in chains. They cannot move. All they can do is stare directly forward, as the chains stop them from turning their heads around. 
    Imagine that far above and behind them blazes a great fire. Between this fire and the captives, a low partition is erected along a path, something like puppeteers use to conceal themselves during their shows.
    <br>
    Socrates: So we are! Now, tell me if you suppose it's possible that these captives ever saw anything of themselves or one another, other than the shadows flitting across the cavern wall before them?
    <br><br>
Glaukon: Certainly not, for they are restrained, all their lives, with their heads facing forward only.
    <br><br>
    Socrates: And that would be just as true for the objects moving to and fro behind them?
    <br><br>
Glaukon: Certainly.
    <br><br>
    Socrates: Now, if they could speak, would you say that these captives would imagine that the names they gave to the things they were able to see applied to real things?
    <br><br>
Glaukon: It would have to be so.
    <br><br>
    Socrates: And if a sound reverberated through their cavern from one of those others passing behind the partition, do you suppose that the captives would think anything but the passing shadow was what really made the sound?
    <br><br>
Glaukon: No, by Zeus.
    <br><br>
    Socrates: Then, undoubtedly, such captives would consider the truth to be nothing but the shadows of the carved objects.
    <br><br>
Glaukon: Most certainly.
