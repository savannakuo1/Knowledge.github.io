   <h1>The Sun</h1>
   <p>“He will find that the sun is the source for the seasons and the years, and governor of every visible thing, and is ultimately the origin of everything previously known.”</p>
   <h1>The Ascend</h1>
   <p>“such captives would consider the truth to be nothing but the shadows of the carved objects.”</p>
   <h1>The Shadow</h1>
   <p>“Imagine one of them is set            from his shackles and immediately made to stand up and bend his neck around, to take steps, to gaze up toward the fire.”</p>
   <h1>The Cave</h1>
   <p>“Imagine that there are people living in a cave deep underground.”</p>
   <p>we all resemble captives who are chained deep within a cavern, who do not yet realize that there is more to reality than the shadows they see against the wall.</p>
