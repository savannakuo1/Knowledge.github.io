    <h1>The Shadow</h1>

<p>
    Socrates: Look again, and think about what would happen if they were released from these chains and these misconceptions. Imagine one of them is set free from his shackles and immediately made to stand up and bend his neck around, to take steps, to gaze up toward the fire. And all of this was painful, and the glare from the light made him unable to see the objects that cast the shadows he once beheld. What do you think his reaction would be if someone informed him that everything he had formerly known was illusion and delusion, but that now he was a few steps closer to reality, oriented now toward things that were more authentic, and able to see more truly? And, even further, if one would direct his attention to the artificial figures passing to and fro and ask him what their names are, would this man not be at a loss to do so? Would he, rather, believe that the shadows he formerly knew were more real than the objects now being shown to him?
    </p>
    <p class="G">Glaukon: Much more real.</p>
    <p>
        Socrates: Now, if he was forced to look directly at the firelight, wouldn't his eyes be pained? Wouldn't he turn away and run back to those things which he normally perceived and understand them as more defined and clearer than the things now being brought to his attention?
    </p>
    <p class="G">Glaukon: That's right.</p>
    <p>
        Socrates: Now, let's say that he is forcibly dragged up the steep climb out of the cavern, and firmly held until finally he stands in the light of the sun. Don't you think that he would be agitated and even begin to complain?
        <br><br>
        Under that light, would his eyes not be nearly blinded, unable to discern any of those things that we ourselves call real?        
    <br><br></p>
    <p class="G">Glaukon: No, he wouldn't see them at first.</p>
    <p>Socrates: It would take time, I suppose, for him to get used to seeing higher things. In the beginning, he might only trace the shadows. Then, reflections of people and other things in the water. Next he would come to see the things themselves. Then he would behold the heavenly bodies, and the heaven itself by night, seeing the light of the stars and the moon with greater ease than the sun and its light by day.</p>
    <p class="G">Glaukon: Indeed so.</p>
    <p>Socrates: And then, I think, he would at last be able to gaze upon the sun itself--neither as reflected in water, nor as a phantom image in some other place, but in its own place as it really is.</p>
    <p class="G">Glaukon: Undeniably.</p>
    <p>Socrates: And now, he will begin to reason. He will find that the sun is the source for the seasons and the years, and governor of every visible thing, and is ultimately the origin of everything previously known.</p>
